# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,1,2]
# Output: [1,2]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]

class Solution(object):
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        temp = head
        while (temp and temp.next):
            if (temp.next.val == temp.val):
                temp.next = temp.next.next
                continue
            temp = temp.next
        return head
